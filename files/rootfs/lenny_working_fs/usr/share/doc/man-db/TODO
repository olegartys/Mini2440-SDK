In progress:

* store .so link in the db.
* reduce wasted/duplicated text stored within the databases.
  10-20% database size reduction so far.
* pipeline library:
  - make COMMAND_FUNCTION child reentrant, so it doesn't have to be a
    subprocess; will save lots of forks of zlib children in mandb

In need of attention:

* clear up the use of troff and/or groff
* complete configuration file redesign to allow better dynamic determination 
  of programs/paths/extensions etc.
* look at work done by Andries.
* multiple debug levels?

Case-insensitive lookup transition:

* Solaris layout is broken.
* Need to make sure pointers trigger an exact-case lookup [done for whatis].

Apparently db3's compatibility API is, er, less than compatible.
(Specifically, it isn't possible to write correct error-handling code that
works in the compatibility API, nor that works in both db2 and db3.) I
suppose I have to write a db_newbdb.c now.
