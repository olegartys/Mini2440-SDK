# If AUTO=true, then the vservers with $MARK set will be started on boot
# and stopped on reboot/shutdown. This is the same behavior as invoking
# /etc/init.d/util-vserver start and /etc/init.d/util-vserver stop
# 
# NOTE: if ALWAYS_STOP=true (default), then all vservers are stopped

# vservers will be stopped after, due to ALWAYS_STOP

# boot process will end early
