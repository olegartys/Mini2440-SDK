This package was created by Daniel Jacobowitz <dan@debian.org> on Sun, Aug
8th, 2004.  It was based on the ia32-libs package by Bdale Garbee
<bdale@gag.com>, with considerable help from Goswin von Brederlow
<brederlo@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>.

It includes sources and binaries from the bzip2, glibc,
linux-kernel-headers, ncurses, and zlib Debian packages, which are
distributed under various licenses, referenced below.

ncurses:
This is the Debian prepackaged version of the ncurses
library and terminfo utilities. ncurses/terminfo was originally written
by Pavel Curtis and Zeyd M. Ben-Halim <zmbenhal@netcom.com>, and is
currently held by the Free Software Foundation.

This package was put together by Vaidhyanathan G Mayilrangam
<vaidhy@debian.org> and Joel Klecker <espy@debian.org>, using sources
obtained from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-5.0.tar.gz.

It is based somewhat on work done by Bruce Perens <Bruce@Pixar.com>,
David Engel <david@elo.ods.com>.  Michael Alan Dorman
<mdorman@debian.org>, Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>, James Troup
<jjtroup@comp.brad.ac.uk>, J.H.M. Dassen (Ray)
<jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>, and Galen Hazelwood <galenh@micron.net>
over various years.


Changes:
 * added Debian package maintenance system files
 * changed Makefile.in's to compile with -D_REENTRANT
 * changed configure.in to support proper compilation of debugging libraries
 * Fixed tget{flag,num,str} in lib_termcap ("long" strings work now)

Changes to terminfo.src:
 * Removed ich(1) from linux, screen, vt320
