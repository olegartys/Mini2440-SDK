Notes about the audiofile Debian package
----------------------------------------

The Debian package provides extra man pages for audiofile-config, sfinfo, and
sfconvert.  Furthermore, a patch has been added to prevent audiofile from
looping endlessly on broken wave files whose header advertises too large a file
size. 

Enjoy!
