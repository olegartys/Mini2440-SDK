mc for Debian
-------------

 -  In order to get rid of the commandline history to be full with cd commands
    from the both boxes set this environment variable:
     export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
 
    This is a issue of bash, not of mc. This would fix it.

 -  In newer mc versions ( >=4.6.2~pre1-1 ) the behaviour of M-o changed. 
    The old behaviour can now be found on the M-i key.
